							"For privacy / security, ALWAYS round your STORED portfolio balances to as few decimal points as is feasible (AND preferably buy / transfer cryptocurrency in nice rounded amounts too). Then hackers / snoopers cannot as easily guess and potentially follow your transaction history in block explorers online.",

							"ONLY HIGHLY EXPERIENCED DAY TRADERS should attempt timing short term trade entry points (buying, to sell in a few days / weeks at a higher price). The average investor IS MUCH BETTER OFF HOLDING LONG TERM, and ".strtoupper($app_config['general']['btc_primary_currency_pairing'])."-cost averaging your cryptocurrency purchases / buys on a weekly or monthly basis (buying the same amount at regular intervals).

                    "For longer shot (#VERY# high risk) small marketcap assets, HIGHLY consider getting #NO MORE THAN# a 'moon bag' worth (#NO MORE THAN# between 1% and 5% of your portfolio PER-ASSET, AND A TOTAL OF #NO MORE THAN# 10% of your portfolio). If it goes down 50% and keeps going down, sell it and you don't lose much. If it goes up between 400% and 800% (4x to 8x original value) or higher, rebalance it to only be between 1% and 5% of your portfolio again (by selling some of it). CAREFULLY TRACK YOUR SUCCESS RATE. If you are no good at picking long shots, stick to the largest and oldest marketcaps instead.",

TO-DO NOTES
############################################################################################################################
Try sticking with small infrastructure changes, and breaking up large changes into small milestones. 
Then plenty of time is spent on UX / testing / logging / debugging.
Always test in a WebKit-based browser [Epiphany|Safari], Firefox, and Chromium

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"NEXT ON THE LIST" SUMMARY SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Post on hive, telegram, discord, Twitter, Facebook (and r/CryptoMarkets and r/CryptoCurrency on MAJOR RELEASES) whenever there is a new release of the app.

ALWAYS do everything in the optimizations / bugs / tests / ux / qa / other section of this list FIRST, before adding ANY new features (find every flaming turd before we start a dumpster fire).

Youtube channels on the resources page, that MAY BE DYING (keep an eye on them): IMineBlocks.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////
OPTIMIZATIONS / BUGS / TESTS / UX / QA / OTHER SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Keep an eye on the Bitcoin "Unit Value" compared to the "Trade Value". They don't need to match perfectly, BUT they should ALWAYS be pretty close to the same.


Add BTSE API: https://api.btse.com/spot/api/v3.2/market_summary


Add bithumb API


Store the php timeout as a cached var, and compare the CACHED app config to it at runtime. If they differ from each other, delete the root htaccess and user.ini files to trigger recreating them with an updated php timeout. Also make sure the php timeout setting and updating logic / functions are using the CACHED app config.


Write debugging tests for rss feeds.


Use new internal api function calls as much as possible for the tests logic we had already built.


See if exchange API data arrays can be manipulated slightly to build a reusable module for every exchange's API calls.


In debug mode, maybe add our new 'used ram' stat instead (that doesn't include buffers / cached ram).


Check optimization by enabling "telemetry" debug mode, and reviewing debugging logs.


Check log formatting for every debug mode.


Make sure all currency markets are added ONLY FOR MAJOR EXCHANGES (ALREADY DID THIS FOR KRAKEN).


Review Help FAQ, and config.php settings documentation.


Cross-browser test RTL (right to left) effects from middle eastern currency symbols being injected into the interface output for those currencies


Test unicode mobile text message with no space in front of hex-encoded data (forgot to try that, coded and ready to go now...see content_data_encoding() and /DOCUMENTATION-ETC/Developing-maintaining/DEBUGGING.txt).


Code review ALL functions / logic (especially loops, for efficiency).

FEATURES / STRUCTURING SECTION
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Give cron plugins a [plugin name]-config.php file for parameters like gui menus / content, mysql data table structure, etc. Also give cron plugins a dedicated admin page (if any are activated).


Create a cron plugin to let you know when a raw market value has gone below / above a certain exact value at a specific exchange (good for knowing when / if your order fills).


Have balance summary at bottom of portfolio page show percent of MISCASSETS too.


Create "Export your feeds" link on News page, to XML / JSON format file download (like exporting portfolio logic).


For each category_key => category_value loop app config, to automate categorizing new admin settings tabs...selects for arrays, text fields for strings. Maybe certain key names get checkbox / radio button fields.


On admin config tabs, add logic to have onchange update a tracking value FOR THAT TAB ONLY, so if a user changes a setting and DOESN'T SAVE IT AND CLICKS ANOTHER TAB / LINK they get an alert to confirm leaving the tab without saving their changes.


Once an admin interface is fully built out, permanently switch out the app config upgrade logic for our new logic (already built, just enable in secured cache logic).


Add force reset logic for app config, if cached app version number is non-existent or below a certain version, so we force a complete reset for non-backwards-compatible upgrades.


On admin config reset tab, have "reset app config to default settings" button (with js confirm alert when pushed) that refreshes ALL the cached app_config from config.php settings.


Admin import / export of settings (consider security implications CAREFULLY...maybe include an optional checkbox to encrypt to zip file with our new zip encryption feature).


When cached app config is independent of config.php updating-wise, use the show / hide link to have an optional email field on the admin registration page, and mention it enables password resetting via email.


Add Uniswap API: https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/graphprotocol/uniswap


Mail trading notes to admin email, only if user logged in as admin.


Option to use new zip file encryption password feature to encrypt portfolio spreadsheet exports when downloading exported portfolio data.


Add additional ability to do telegram webhooks, to query asset prices at different exchanges through telegram chat with the chat bot. Example: "/price ETH/USDT @ Binance"


Documentation for Webhook features


Add webhook keys on admin page.


In the "loading charts" logic, add a timer that logs the time it takes to load all Shown Charts, and prints results to the console log.


Add google home support via direct connect on same network, OR via IFTTT (whichever is most feasible).


Add IFTTT support (alexa / google home / whatever supported devices).


Add admin settings feature to restore chart data from the zip archive backups (with admin authentication ONLY). Chart restore by prepending, so any existing data remains, BUT only if timestamp is newer than newest backups timestamp. Trigger restore from newest backups folder backup by placing a blank file named RESTORE_CHARTS in the queue directory.


Add setting to enable access stats modal, maybe include an optional password setting to require login to view it in the UI if password is set. Store access data in flat file / json format (so mulitiple values can be read back into the app before updating, then updated values saved back in json overwriting previously saved values). Last 50 unique ip addresses, showing ip address's last user agent / last visit time / total visits count. Drop any over 50 ip addresses off the list based on oldest timestamps. Store visitor ip address data (user agent, etc) in an array key based off ip address (json format). Add visitor stats for API and webhook visits (whenever the stats logic is built out for the interface).


Look into an auto-update feature like WordPress has (downloads a zip file upgrade, and exctracts it overwriting the old app files).


Add Google and Microsoft translate API as options to translate the portfolio interface and price alerts.


Create github wiki with the current documentation for the portfolio app.


Add localcryptos API support?


Wrap all interface English within a "placeholder" lang_translate() function call. Then from a developer perspective you can still fully see the interface logic, and build out translation logic over time later. 


Create help page modal for explanations on all config.php settings. Then we can run this through the upcoming lang_translate() function.


Build tool that finds localbitcoins markets not added yet


Add twilio.com and clicksend.com mobile text messaging support


Add drop-down menu feature next to "Save Updated Portfolio" buttons for "save as": cookie data | session data | only post data.


2-way encryption option (unlocked with 6 digit PIN) for storing coin amounts (IN COOKIES ONLY, NO DATABASE STORAGE !EVER!), with "quick lock" to quickly re-hide portfolio data (staying hidden persists on page load / reload as well with a cookie).


Check out cryptocompare.com API.


Build Decred staking calculator.


Create a "Desktop Edition" using PHPDesktop (https://github.com/cztomczak/phpdesktop/wiki), call the hosted version "Server Edition".


Use SQLite for any data storage that needs query capability (can also be used in PHPDesktop version, as it supports SQLite). 


Stats in UI using chart data (if available), to show and compare spot / volume percent changes over an end-user-defined time period for a number of assets (example: BTC / LTC / ETH / XMR spot price percentage changes / 24hr volume percentage changes from April 6th 2019 to November 22nd 2019). Shows trends on which assets are performing better for a certain time period.


Add chart sorting by crypto and usd price / volume percentage change over 1 hour / 1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 90 days / 6 months / 1 year.


Look into X day moving average overlay for charts.


Add market stats summaries from chart data, like pie charts for exchange volume on certain pairs, etc.


Simple trading bot, to run from cron / cli (with SQL-based admin authentication / web UI for configuration)


Add a "calculate current portfolio's performance in BTC and [fiat currency] over X time period" feature, which uses the currently-cached asset markets charts to create a downloadable chart showing what you current potfolio assets have been worth in BTC / Fiat over X time period. This would help to more easily determine non-performant assets, and aid in efficient portfolio rebalancing.

MAYBE SECTION

Alerts when RSS feeds have new entries?


Make default btc exchange in config.php optional, and auto-configure if invalid or left blank, based off the default primary currency setting (still log errors though). Additionally, consider defaulting to USD if the primary currency setting is invalid / blank as well (as long as we also error log any detected issues there too)??


Turn string / array manipulations function file into a class.


SQL-based accounts for storing configuration settings per-user (including setting up new assets available at supported exchanges), BUT !NEVER! STORES PORTFOLIO DATA (FOR PRIVACY / SECURITY-SAKE).


When sql host config has been set in config.php, BUT DATABASE SETUP HAS NOT RUN YET, have the UI require entering the sql user password to initiate database setup (for security)


Maintain sql-based config as completely separate module(s) from the file-based config (config.php), except for the sql host connection / authentication details (put those at the top of the config.php configurations).


Maybe hashed password can be re-hashed with a unique per-browser install semi-constant or constant (like machine name or user agent), to securely store a persistent / semi-persisent login cookie (that hackers cannot steal and run on another machine to auto login easily)? Maybe feasible more so with a 7 day (or less) expiring cookie?


Convert all long hand javascript to jquery?


Save trading notes via the new ajax.php logic (rather than reload the entire app)?


Should GRIN mining difficulty be different for each cuckoo level in the mining calculator?


Add memory limit to all runtimes?


Maybe do a gains pie chart and a separate losses pie chart for the gains / losses summary?


Comparison chart(s) showing historical asset price vs what you paid per-token?


Add auto-install script option to install NGINX (https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/web-server/nginx.md)?


Maybe add feature to detect new / removed markets?


Consider error log alerts if system load is over 2, or free memory goes under 25 megabytes?


Alerts if NOT admin ip address visiting (admin ip stored in config setting)?


See if at all feasible to fully modularize mining calculators to be added via config settings?

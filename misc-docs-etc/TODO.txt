Buy a google home mini cheap on ebay, and develop price alerts compatibility for it.


Add header login nav like prototype for zilliqa block explorer (use the developed account system structure too).


Add an alert bell icon in upcoming header login nav, and have alerts make it red and be a drop-down info bubble clicking it, rather than alerts printed in the footer.


2-way encryption option (unlocked with 6 digit PIN) for storing coin amounts (IN COOKIES ONLY, NO DATABASE STORAGE !EVER!), with "quick lock" to quickly re-hide portfolio data (staying hidden persists on page load / reload as well with a cookie).


SQL-based accounts for storing configuration settings per-user (including setting up new assets available at supported exchanges), BUT !NEVER! STORES PORTFOLIO DATA (FOR PRIVACY / SECURITY-SAKE).


Add feature to restore chart data from the zip archive backups (with SQL-based admin authentication ONLY).


Stats in UI using chart data (if available), to show and compare spot / volume percent changes over an end-user-defined time period for a number of assets (example: BTC / LTC / ETH / XMR spot price percentage changes / 24hr volume percentage changes from April 6th 2019 to November 22nd 2019). Shows trends on which assets are performing better for a certain time period.


Add chart sorting by crypto and usd price / volume percentage change over 1 hour / 1 day / 1 week / 1 month / 90 days / 6 months / 1 year.


Add market stats summaries from chart data, like pie charts for exchange volume on certain pairs, etc.


RESTFUL API system for requesting asset attributes (USD spot price / vol , etc)


Simple trading bot, to run from cron / cli (with SQL-based admin authentication / web UI for configuration)

See if at all feasible to fully modularize mining calculators to be added via config settings?


Using primary chart data files as the source, dynamically create and cache extra chart data files for 1week / 1month / 3month / 6month / 1year / 2year / 4year charts (every hour?), using different minimum time intervals, to improve scaling UI integration (UI load times, as more chart data is collected)?


Add security nonce to thwart CSRF attacks on cookie portfolio data / SQL-based (authenticated) admin pages?


Look into graceful 'loading...' placeholder until page is fully loaded?
